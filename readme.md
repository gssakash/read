âœ¨ MapAlly is a mobile application with location access that can detect the user's current
movements on any road can reveal the road's current status. If a user is idle
on a road for an extended period of time, a notification is sent to the user
requesting them to report the present location's status. When a user provides
any valid information, such as traffic accidents, crimes, sicknesses, fires,
natural catastrophes, or road closures the user will be rewarded with Reward
Points. 

Any major difficulties are reported to the appropriate control division in
the area using the current location, such as automatically calling a police
station in the event of a theft or murder. The Reward Points can be redeemed
later for things like free bus tickets over a certain distance, a wonderful meal,
or a cup of coffee..
